<h3 align="center">Glass Morphism Effect Using Flutter</h3>

* Glassmorphism is a UI design trend that combines transparency, blur effects, and vibrant colors to create a frosted glass appearance. This effect mimics the look of glass surfaces and is used to give depth and hierarchy to the user interface. In Flutter, achieving the glassmorphism effect involves using widgets like BackdropFilter, ClipRRect, Container, and ImageFilter to create the desired visual style.



Key Characteristics of Glassmorphism

* Transparency: The use of semi-transparent backgrounds.
* Blur Effects: Applying a blur effect to the background content.
* Frosted Glass Look: Combining transparency and blur to create the frosted glass effect.
* Vibrant Backgrounds: Often used with colorful and vibrant backgrounds to enhance the glass effect.
